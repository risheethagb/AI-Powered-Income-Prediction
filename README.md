# My-eCornell-Portfolio

For this project, I applied machine learning techniques by implementing a Random Forest model to predict individual income using the UCI Adult Census dataset. I performed data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing the data to ensure optimal model performance. After implementing the Random Forest, I conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to achieve the best model configuration and evaluated its performance with an AUC-ROC curve, which provided a comprehensive assessment of the model's ability to distinguish between different income classes.
