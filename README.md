# My-eCornell-Portfolio
Includes Jupyter Notebook assignments from Machine Learning Foundations

This Notebook includes my final projectw here I implemented a Random Forest model to predict the income for an individual using census data. I utilized various data preperation techniques to ensure the data was ready to be trained on. AFter implementing my Random Forest, I trained the hyperparameters to get the best midel, and then evaluated this model using an AUC-ROC curve.
